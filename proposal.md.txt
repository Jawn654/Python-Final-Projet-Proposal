## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Disord Bot

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

My project will be a discord bot that I can use in me and my friend's personal servers.

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My discord bot will be able to send certain mesagges when someone says a certain thig in chat. I would also like to link the bot to a youtube channel or other social media account so that the bot will send a link whenever a post is made on the social media acocunt. If it's not too difficult, I also want the bot to be able to join voice calls and play music
